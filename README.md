10. Run node server.js - creates the files for mysql.
11. Edit handlebars' files.

API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

Tests

1. Run node server.js then open the web browser and enter localhost address.
2. OR use Mocha (a Javascript test framework) and Chai (library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework) to test web application.
